 ### **What are the values that we expect of our community and those who engage?**
 
 Our program finds strength in diversity and inclusion. In all our interactions, we aspire to embody and champion these values as a program and as a community.

#### Be respectful and inclusive
- Respect differences of opinion, just because someone holds a different viewpoint from your own, doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. 
- Make a conscious effort to include people who differ from you.
- Remember that people have varying communication styles different from your own. oShow a willingness to understand more about the experiences of others. 
- Ask questions to understand.

#### Lead with empathy 
- Listen with purpose, seek to understand before being understood. 
- Conduct yourself professionally and be kind to others.  
- Show understanding for another person’s situation and emotions.  

#### Be friendly, open, and welcoming
- Assume good intent and interpret others’ statements or questions in good faith. 
- Foster environments that allow all members to feel connected to each other and the community. 
- Promote a friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions. 

#### Be thoughtful 
- Think about how others will interpret your words, productive, clear communication requires effort. 
- Be aware of your strengths and weaknesses and how your own behavior and reactions influence others’ emotions and actions. 
- Sometimes it is best to pause from commenting or reacting immediately to feedback/constructive criticism. 
- We will make mistakes. When others are not at their best, we should reach out, offer support, and seek to understand. When you are at fault, listen, and ask how you can make things right.
